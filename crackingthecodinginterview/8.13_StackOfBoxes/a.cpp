// Stack of Boxes: You have a stack of n boxes, with widths W i'
// heights hi' and depths d 1? The boxes cannot be rotated and can
// only be stacked on top of one another if each box in the stack is
// strictly larger than the box above it in width, height. and
// depth. Implement a method to compute the height of the tallest
// possible stack.The height of a stack is the sum of the heights of
// each box.
