// https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/description/

// Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S witch
// will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).

// For example,
// S = “ADOBECODEBANC”
// T = “ABC”
// minimum window is “BANC”

// S = “bba”
// T = “ab”
// minimum window is “ba”

// If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T,
// return the empty string “”;

// if there are multiple such windows, you are guaranteed that there
// will always be only one unique minimum window in S.
